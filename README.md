# 🧠 Emotionpedia [Submitted]

Welcome to my Swift Student Challenge 2025 submission! [Click to check out the demo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3oGPtrsfME)

Emotionpedia is an interactive app that helps autistic children understand and manage their emotions in a fun and intuitive way. Designed with accessibility in mind: no sensory overload! Engaging activities with soft colors, simple layouts, clear language, and optional sound toggles make everything easy to process. :)

It focuses on two main emotions: happiness and anger.

# 🔍 What does the app do?

- Exploring situations: Kids explore different scenarios, tapping on objects to see how they might trigger emotions.
- Mimicking expressions: Using ARKit, they practice facial expressions. The app tracks key facial features (eyes, nose, cheeks, mouth) and gives real-time feedback on accuracy!
- Expressing and managing: Fun activities help with emotional expression and regulation. Happy? Clap along with the music—Vision-based hand tracking ensures it works even with soft claps! Angry? Blow into the mic to pop virtual soap bubbles!
- Reward system: After completing an emotion cycle, RealityKit displays a snapshot taken during facial tracking. It can be saved or printed as a study card.
- Pause and Breathe: A break button triggers a guided counting exercise using Apple’s Speech framework, perfect for overwhelming moments.

Growing up, I realized how life-changing emotional skills can be. As I explored this, I came across the unique challenges that many autistic children face in recognizing and managing emotions. That's how Emotionpedia was born, and creating it felt like a big hug. 🫂
